List of Algorithms and Data Structures implementations in R

## Idea

Implement algorithms and data structures in R


## Why?

- It is a good way to learn how to write functions in R
- When you interview for Data Science positions, you will be likely to asked how to implement X. Example, how do you create a power function (exponentiating by squaring)
