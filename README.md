List of Algorithms and Data Structures implementations in R

## Idea

Place to collectively create R implementations of algorithms from scratch

## Why?

- It is a good way to learn how to write functions in R
- When you interview for Data Science positions, you will be likely to asked how to implement X. Example, how do you create a power function (exponentiating by squaring)

## Good Resources

Thank you Heather Turner for the resources! 


## Some ideas of algorithms to be included:

- Exponentiation by Squaring
- Simple Sort (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merging Sort, ...)
- Difference of Squares
